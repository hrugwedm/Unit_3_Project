### **Overview**
In this project, we analyzed electricity data for approximately 216 countries using data provided by the client. We began by extracting the data from the clientâ€™s database, which was in JSON format. The process involved transforming the JSON files into a long format, cleaning the data, filtering, and merging it with metadata. Finally, we saved the cleaned data into CSV files and used Power BI to generate valuable insights.



### **Objectives**

1) **Trends in Electricity Generation by Source**
2) **Comparison Between Electricty Generation by Nuclear Source and Income Group**
3) **Least Electrified Countires**
4) **Electricity Loss Across Different Regions**
5) **Comparison between Electricity Access of Urban to the Rural region**   

### **Tools used** :

1) Pandas library
2) JSON library
3) PowerBI Tool

### **Methodology**

1) **Data Acquisition**: The data was imported from the specified location.
2) **Data Conversion**: Initially in JSON format, the data was converted into a DataFrame. It was then melted to improve analysis and understanding, and finally saved in CSV format.
3) **Data Cleaning**: Using the Pandas library, the DataFrame was cleaned by removing duplicate values and unnecessary columns, as well as handling null and missing values.
4) **Data Visualization**: After cleaning, the data was loaded into Power BI to create visualizations and an interactive dashboard to uncover key insights.

### **Quick Summary**
**Here's a snippet of code that demonstrates the process described, followed by an explanation**

**Load Metadata**:
The metadata file (Metadata.csv) is loaded into a DataFrame. This file contains additional information about countries, including Region and IncomeGroup.

**Define File Mapping**:
A dictionary file_info maps each JSON file to its corresponding new column name and CSV output file name.

**Load JSON Data**:
Each JSON file is read and converted into a DataFrame.

**Clean DataFrame**:
The first row of each DataFrame, which contains header information, is removed.
The remaining row is set as the new header.
Reset the DataFrame index.

**Melt DataFrame**:
The DataFrame is transformed from wide to long format using pd.melt(). The Year column is created, and the values are placed under a new column name as specified in file_info.

**Remove Null Values**:
Rows with null values in the Year and values columns are removed.
Year is converted to numeric and filtered to keep only years greater than 1999.

**Merge Metadata**:
The Country Code from the melted DataFrame is used to merge with the metadata DataFrame, adding Region and IncomeGroup columns.
Rows with null values in Region or IncomeGroup are removed.

**Reorder Columns**:
The columns are reordered to place the value column at the end of the DataFrame.

**Save to CSV**:
The cleaned and processed DataFrame is saved to a CSV file as specified in file_info.

**Completion**:
A message is printed to indicate that data processing is complete and the individual CSV files have been created.

### **Conclusion**

1. **Global Electrification:**
   - Out of 216 countries analyzed, the world electrification rate stands at 80.71%.
   - Urban areas have significantly higher access to electricity (90.03%) compared to rural areas (76.23%).

2. **Electricity Production by Source:**
   - There has been a declining trend in electricity generation from oil and nuclear sources over the years.

3. **Nuclear Energy Production:**
   - High-income countries dominate nuclear energy production, contributing 74.71% of the total.
   - Upper-middle-income countries account for 16.83% of nuclear energy production.

4. **Electricity Loss:**
   - Sub-Saharan Africa experiences the highest electricity loss rate at 21.23%, indicating inefficiencies in the region's power distribution.

5. **Electricity Access Disparities:**
   - Significant gap in electricity access between urban and rural areas, especially in Sub-Saharan Africa, where rural access is only 28.65%.

6. **Least Electrified Countries:**
   - The least electrified countries are primarily located in Africa, with South Sudan having the lowest electrification rate at 3.68%.

7. **Geographical Insights:**
   - The world map highlights significant disparities in electricity access across different regions, with the highest access in North America and Europe and the lowest in Sub-Saharan Africa.

This analysis underscores the global disparities in electricity production and access, highlighting the need for targeted efforts to improve electrification, particularly in rural areas and lower-income regions.
